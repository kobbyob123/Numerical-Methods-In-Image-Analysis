# 🖼️ Numerical Methods of Image Analysis
### Summer Semester Course for Learning Image Analysis

This repository serves as a code log and implementation workspace for the **Numerical Methods of Image Analysis** course during the 2025/2026 academic year. The content covers the mathematical theory of digital image processing, from basic pixel manipulation to advanced object recognition.

## 🛠 17/02/2026: Still on Foundations
The current implementations focus on the initial stages of the syllabus, specifically **Numeric Image Representation** and **Pixel Values Transforms**

## 🗃️ Files created
  * `Lecture 2/chessboard.m`: Naive implementation of a simple chessboar...have to improve and make it elegant
  * `Lecture 2/transformations.m` : Basic commands for working with images, ie. cropping, resizing, rotating, etc
  * `Lecture 3/imageDetect.m`: Basic implementation of object detection using image subtraction...still in progress
